Hello!

My name is Adam. I'm trying to learn as many technical skils as possible after working an IT support job for going on 3 years now. My fiance and I are looking at moving up to northern Michigan and I want to engluf myself in as many new skills as possible so we can both succeed after we move. I might not have much time, but I'm determined to learn as much as possible and create a website to show how much I have attempted to learn!
